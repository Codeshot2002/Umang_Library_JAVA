This is a git repo where I create my own data structure which is very easy to use :-
1) Dictionary in java (EASY TO USE & ELIMINATE THE USE OF ITERATOR)

----Backstory----
One day was just solving questions on leetcode where I came across some questions of maps in which you were supposed to add some key value pairs
into it and search some keys from values, as I was a java user searching keys from values from a map in java is pretty confusing, firstly you create
a iterator, then get a entry set out of it and then shove it up your ass to get the values or keys out of it....

So this gave me inspiration to create my own datastructure inspired from python.... THE DICTIONARY but in java, so I named it uDictionary starting with
my intital hehe xD

Feel free to add new improvements, features or data structure into this repo :)

THE END...
